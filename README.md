# Equa_ Sides_Of_An_Array


Finds an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. 
If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

{1,2,3,4,3,2,1} will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side of the index 
({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6.
